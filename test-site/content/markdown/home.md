A test site that's using the Epistemological Letters! This is just a quick demo, to show how easily Marble can be customized. This test uses a single [IIIF manifest](https://presentation-iiif.library.nd.edu/collection/epistemological-letters) file in it's configuration, but we wrote a little script to pull in all of the child manifests that you see below. We've also added a University of Notre Dame, Office of the Provost "Branding Bar" at the top that does not exist in the default site configuration.

We've even created a custom [error page](/404.html)
