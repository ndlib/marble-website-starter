A test site that's using the Epistemological Letters! This is just a quick demo, to show how easily Marble can be customized. This test uses a single [IIIF manifest](https://presentation-iiif.library.nd.edu/collection/epistemological-letters) file in it's configuration, but we wrote a little script to pull in all of the child manifests that you see below.

This is a quick demo, so we've opted to not include search or log in functionality, so you may notice the absence of a search box or the default login button.

One "customization" you may notice is that we've  added a University of Notre Dame - Office of the Provost "Branding Bar" at the top that does not exist in the default site configuration.

Another thing we've done is create a custom [error page](/404.html)
