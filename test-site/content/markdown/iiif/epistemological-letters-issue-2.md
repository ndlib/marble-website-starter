This is a custom layout the does not exist in the default configuration. It was added just for this test site in a global configuration and can be used on any number pages just by specifying the new layout's name. Letters number [6](/item/epistemological-letters-issue-6), [7](/item/epistemological-letters-issue-7), and [8](/item/epistemological-letters-issue-8) also use this layout.

Another thing you can do is customize an individual page. You can see an example on [The Third Epistemological Letter](/item/epistemological-letters-issue-3).
