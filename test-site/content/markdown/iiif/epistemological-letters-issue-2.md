Here is a page that was made with a different layout, just to illustrate that you can (not that you should). It looks a lot like the default, default layout, but we've switched the Mirador Viewer and the Meta Data Display around just to confuse and amaze you. [Here](https://marble-test.library.nd.edu/item/epistemological-letters-issue-2) is what this same page looks like on the Marble Test site.
