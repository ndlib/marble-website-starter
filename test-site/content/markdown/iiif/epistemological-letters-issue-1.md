Here is a description that has been added that does not exist in the IIIF manifest file that was used to create this page. You could put anything you want here to expand upon the content that was automagically generated by the site. The possibilities are limitless, well maybe not limitless, but there's a lot of flexibility to be had for sure! [Here](https://marble-test.library.nd.edu/item/epistemological-letters-issue-1) is what this same page looks like on the Marble Test site.

Also, did you know each IIIF Manifest, gets it's own page created in a Mirador Viewer. It's true! You can [see an example here](/item/epistemological-letters-issue-1/mirador).

Another thing you can do is customize an individual page. You can see an example on [The Second Epistemological Letter](/item/epistemological-letters-issue-2).
