Here is a special page that has it's layout defined in the markdown file used to create this specific page. It is the __only__ page with this layout.

It looks different just to illustrate that you can change the layout of any single page (not that you should). It looks a lot like the default layout for an "Item", but we've switched the Mirador Viewer and the Meta Data Display around just to confuse and amaze you.

Another example of a custom layout is on [the fourth letter](/item/epistemological-letters-issue-4).
