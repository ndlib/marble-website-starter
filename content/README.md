# Content Folder

This is where the content of your marble-website-starter lives. The following files and directories are expected:

* `manifests.json` ***(required)*** - This file contains a top level IIIF manifest that details the structure of the majority of the site including all collections and items that will have their own pages.

* `menus.js` ***(required)*** - This includes all the menus that will be used in your site including the main navigation menu links, footer menu links, and submenus included on any markdown pages.

* `exhibitions.js` ***(required)*** - This includes the content for the Exhibitions page.

* `markdown/` *(optional)* - This folder contains the markdown content for static content pages on your site. No specific pages or naming contention exists, but examples include: 'About Us', 'Contact', 'FAQs', etc.

**TODO**

The contents of this directory will be added to `.gitignore` and will need to be included during the install phase of site building.
