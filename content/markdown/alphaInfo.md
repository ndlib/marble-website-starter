This is an Alpha prototype version of the digital collections site for the Snite Museum of Art and Hesburgh Libraries. You will find that some of the pages, icons, and buttons on this site do not function as they should yet. The project team will be refining and developing this site over the course of the grant period (through July 2021).

In addition, the prototype contains a limited set of content from the Snite Museum of Art, Rare Books and Special Collections Department, and University Archives (both in Hesburgh Libraries). We will add more content over the coming months so check back regularly.
