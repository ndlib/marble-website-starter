The project team will be refining and developing this site over the course of the grant period (through July 2021).</p>\n<h2>Content</h2>\n<p>In addition, the prototype contains a limited set of content from the Snite Museum of Art, Rare Books and Special Collections Department, and University Archives (both in Hesburgh Libraries).
