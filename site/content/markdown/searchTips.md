There are two ways to search on this Alpha site: basic and advanced. Because the prototype contains a small set of records, you may find that your search terms return no or few results.

## Basic Search
The basic search bar appears on the top of the homepage and every other page in the site.

Use the basic search bar for broad keyword searching. Want to narrow your results? Filters appear on the left side of the page when you hit the “search” button. More filter options will be added as the site is developed further.

## Advanced Search
The advanced search options can be found below the basic search bar at the top of the homepage and every other page on the site.


The advanced options allow you to begin with a more focused search.
