You can use our basic search feature and filters to expand and narrow your search. Because the site contains a small set of records, you may find that your search terms return no or few results.

## Basic Search
The basic search bar appears on the top of the homepage and every other page in the site.

Use the basic search bar for broad keyword searching. You can search for a particular artist, or a date, or an event in history, or any other keyword that you would like. The site’s search engine will then try to find whatever term or terms you’ve entered anywhere that term might appear in the record for an object. Your search terms will then be highlighted in the search results.


## Search Filters
After you conduct a keyword search, you will see a set of search filters on the left side of the results page. There is a limited set of these as we continue to refine this functionality. As soon as you select one of the filter options, it will narrow down your search results. Selected filters are displayed just underneath the main search bar. If you would like to remove a filter that you previously selected, you can click on the “x” icon located next to the filter flag.
