The beta site allows you to create your own portfolios to save, share, and annotate items from the library and art museum. In our Beta site, you will need a University of Notre Dame Net ID and credentials in order to use this feature. We plan to build an alternate option for guests to create a site log in.

In the upper right corner of the site, you will see a “Log in” link. If you click on this for the first time, you will be promoted to sign in using your Notre Dame credentials and will need to go through the Okta sign in process. When you first log in, you will see a page for you to enter some information about yourself to fill out your profile. After completing this step, you will see your dashboard where new portfolios will appear when you create them.

To start creating a portfolio, you can either start from your 1) dashboard or 2) an object page. For option 1), you will find a button on the top of the dashboard page “Create New Portfolio.” If you click on this, you will be directed to a page where you can start editing and adding to a new portfolio. You can change the title, add a short description, select a portfolio layout, and set privacy settings. Once you do these, you can return to the homepage to start searching for items to add to your portfolio.

For option 2), you must first be logged into the website. After finding an object that you would like to add to your portfolio, click on the “Save to a portfolio” button found above the primary object image. When selected, you will see a drop-down menu that allows you to add the object to any existing portfolios or you can create a new portfolio. If you decide to create new, you will be given the option to name your portfolio before adding anything to it. You can add items by selecting the “Add” button next to each portfolio title in the dropdown menu or remove items by selecting the “remove” button.
