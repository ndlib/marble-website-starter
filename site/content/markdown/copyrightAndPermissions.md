As such, these collections are made available for use and download as presentation-quality images through a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial ([CC BY-NC 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/)) designation. You may not use the materials for commercial purposes, and you must give appropriate credit to the appropriate holding repository.

When funded through grants or other external means, collections may be made available as open access, using the Creative Commons Zero ([CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)) designation for images and their related data. In these instances, we ask that image reproductions be accompanied by a credit line, displayed with the image, for the appropriate repository.

Some collections are restricted by copyright law, donor-imposed restrictions, or other circumstances. In these instances, images may be displayed at a reduced resolution and not available for download. The Libraries’ collections also include materials that are considered orphan works, which also will be displayed at a reduced resolution and not available for download.

High-resolution images for publication or distribution may be available and requested through the appropriate repository, whose contact information is displayed adjacent to the image. Fees may apply.
