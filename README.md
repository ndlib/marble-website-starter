The [Hesburgh Libraries](https://library.nd.edu) and [Snite Museum](https://sniteartmuseum.nd.edu/) of Art at the University of Notre Dame received a grant from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation in December 2017 to develop a unified online collections platform to encourage comparative research, innovative joint exhibitions, and deeper integration of artwork, rare books, archival resources, and cultural artifacts into University teaching.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1. **Install Gatsby**

   Note: this assumes that you already have Node.js and npm (the Node package manager) installed

   Run at the cli:

   ```sh
   npm install -g gatsby-cli
   ```

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the default starter.

    ```sh
    # create a new Gatsby site using the default starter
    gatsby new marble-website-starter https://github.com/ndlib/marble-website-starter
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd marble-website-starter/
    yarn develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._
